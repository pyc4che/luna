# luna

A lightweight local API service built with FastAPI that wraps Bybit’s official REST API to provide enriched market data endpoints — including volatility ranking, candlestick retrieval, and volume cluster analysis from recent trades.

This project lets you run a local server to query Bybit market data via easy REST API endpoints, enabling rapid prototyping, custom dashboards, or integration into your trading systems — all with caching, error handling, and consistent data processing.
